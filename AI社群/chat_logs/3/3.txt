2024-07-14 08:53:31 Bot: Sunflowers exhibit a behavior called heliotropism, which means they move or grow in response to the sun. During their budding and flowering stage, sunflowers face the sun in the east during the morning and then slowly turn westward during the day to maximize their exposure to sunlight. This behavior helps them increase the efficiency of photosynthesis, which is essential for their growth and development. Once the flower has fully bloomed, the face of the sunflower may stop tracking the sun and remain facing east.
