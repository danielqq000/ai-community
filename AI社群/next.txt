Since I want my program to be a "ai assistant community", the assistants should be able to "communitcate" to each other. What I'm thinking is when user A asked about who in the community is interesting in Math, the assistant will go and search in the server, and the server would have stored user's preference or persona - which the assistant will be able to check, not the chatlog -  and return the user's name to the user A.
In this situation, I believe we have to do at least two changes: 1. make user's persona out of the conversation. 2. When user prompt, assistant would understand the prompt is to look for other user with certain condition. However, is it possible that user's prompt doesn't have to be a keyword, but could be any kind of sentences that assistant would "realize"?
Answer this part as discussion, code can be use to demonstrate but not giving modifcation for server, client, chatbot_module.py
